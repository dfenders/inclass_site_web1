        <h1>Nau mai ki Tātai</h1>
        <p>Tātai is a place where Māori can share iwi affiliations, with iwi, and the Ministry of Health, to make a positive difference today, and for future generations. It is a data collection tool that will provide iwi with much better health information.</p>
        <p>Sharing your iwi affiliations is a way to ensure we, as Māori, are contributing to worthwhile and high-quality datasets about iwi, for iwi. Tātai has been created in partnership with Māori, for Māori.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The Government has struggled to provide iwi with high quality health information about their people, but knows that needs to change.</p>
        <p>With good health information iwi can influence and advocate for a health system that keeps people healthy and supports us all to deliver greater equity for Māori.</p>
        <p>With good health information iwi can make data informed decisions around how to invest in the wellbeing of iwi, hapū and whānau.</p>
        <p>Sharing your iwi affiliations with us contributes to a dataset that can be used to maximise our potential as Māori.</p>
        <p>The need for data that is reliable, timely, relevant, available and accessible for Māori and iwi has never been so important.</p>
        <p>The information that is collected will be provided to iwi to help inform and strengthen iwi strategies, and progress towards their self-determined vision and outcomes. The government will also use it to support more equitable health outcomes for Māori.</p>
        <p>It is also an opportunity for iwi to connect you and other people who share a similar whakapapa and iwi and get a better understanding of where they are across Aotearoa.</p>

            <h2>Strengthen Datasets about Māori</h2>
            <p>This is an opportunity to contribute your iwi information to a dataset about the population and growth of your iwi.</p>
            <p>With the collection of this data iwi can use the information as a tool to understand iwi population status and better understand where Māori, iwi, hapū and whānau live, so that the delivery of resources and services can be coordinated more easily and Māori have access to services faster and more efficiently.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Iwi Resourcing</h2>
            <p>We know that there is a greater need to ensure that iwi are adequately resourced to provide greater opportunities for what Māori can be empowered to do and how iwi can be better supported.</p>
            <p>Collecting and updating iwi affiliation data will enable iwi to have more quality data to plan where to put resources and develop programmes, services and interventions by Māori, for Māori.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Future Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Contributing to this kaupapa gives your iwi better information to plan ahead and it will help Māori have the autonomy to implement initiatives, processes, and address areas of need & concern as defined, and as witnessed by iwi.</p>
            <p>It is a way to raise the levels of equity and development for our people, and address areas of need.</p>

                <h3>Who is behind the kaupapa?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Ministry of Health is leading the project with governance of the project made of Māori data experts from DataILG, Te Puni Kōkiri, Ministry of Education, StatsNZ, Ministry of Health. Together the aim is to set the collection up, then transfer governance and management back to Māori for use by iwi and to share with the Ministry to enhance equity and support better health outcomes for Māori in the future.

                <h3>What is the background of the name, Tātai?</h3>
                <p>
                    There were a number of names considered for this mahi, Hono, Tātai Hono and Tātai. The kaupapa behind the choice was that iwi derives from whakapapa. Linking your iwi data with your health data helps revitalise whakapapa, protect whakapapa and support future generations.

                    Design: Whāriki is a place where we share dialogue. Whāriki are also used to place taonga. Today our taonga is trying to collate mātauranga/whakapapa so we can understand the needs of an iwi group. Mangopare are used to represent strength and knowledge. The fusion of the weave and mangopare represents the connecting and reconnecting, mo ake tonu atu.

                <h3>Who is collecting my data?</h3>
                <p>
                    The collection, sharing, access to and use of iwi affiliation data for iwi, will initially be managed by the Ministry of Health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a multi-party governance group, including iwi representation, empowered to recognise and respect Māori perspectives, to ensure the data requirements are consistent with the purposes outlined at the time of collection, and that future developments are designed to meet the key goal of Māori led data decisions for iwi.
